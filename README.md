## 🌍 Overview  
A real-time AI-powered system designed to **reduce urban traffic congestion**, **prioritize emergency vehicles**, and **predict traffic patterns** using **Edge Computing** and **Machine Learning**. Built for smart cities, this solution enables scalable, responsive traffic control without relying solely on cloud infrastructure.

---

## 🔧 Features

- 🛑 **Real-Time Signal Control**  
  Uses live camera feeds and YOLO object detection on edge devices (ESP32-CAM & Raspberry Pi) to control traffic lights based on vehicle density.

- 🚑 **Emergency Vehicle Prioritization**  
  Detects emergency vehicles and creates a **Green Corridor** by automatically altering signal states across intersections.

- 🚗 **Vehicle Classification**  
  Classifies two-wheelers, cars, buses, and trucks using YOLOv8 to determine traffic weightage and manage green time efficiently.

- 🔮 **Traffic Forecasting with AI**  
  Uses **Gemini AI** and **LSTM models** to predict future traffic congestion and optimize routing decisions.

- 📱 **Android App for Users**  
  Displays live signal status, voice-based navigation, emergency alert system, and route suggestions using real-time data.

- ☁️ **Cloud Integration via Firebase**  
  Syncs traffic data, alerts, and signal state information in real-time for coordination between edge devices and the app.
